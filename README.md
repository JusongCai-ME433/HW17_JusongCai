# HW17_JusongCai

In HW17, our goal is to build an image processing app on my Android Device (MEIZU version 6.0) so that the robot is able to detect the color of the route on the map. So here is what I did, similar to the detecting green objects homework, Android app core codes are under the directory "Project_Files/app/src/main" and major files required to be edited are: "MainActivity.java", "activity_main.xml", "AndroidManifest.xml", "device_filter.xml", as well as add the "classes.jar" as the precompiled library. Besides, a map that will be used as our race route is also attached up on this repo for reference. That is all for testing and racing trials for the final Tech Cup.
